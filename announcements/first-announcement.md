I've been working hard to update this page with the features y'all have been requesting from the post in r/litrpg.  
Here's what I've completed so far:
- I've added over 150 books to the collection
- One book in a series has links to all the rest
- You can select more than one filter at a time
- You can filter by author and narrator
- This announcement notification and panel
- A few new achievements and themes to go with them
- +1 / -1 for books
- A popular vs niche slider for discovering books
- The ability to "Mark Complete" books and a panel to show it
- Royal Road support, though I haven't added very much there yet (and you can filter them in or out)
- Many bug fixes

If you don't see your requested feature in here, I might have forgotten it.  That post got way bigger than I was expecting.  Feel free to DM me or put another comment in there and I'll circle back around to it.

Thanks for using this silly little app.  I hope it serves you well.
