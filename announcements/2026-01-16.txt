I've been working hard to update it with the features requested from the post in r/litrpg. This includes:
- I've added over 150 books to the collection
- One book in a series has links to all the rest
- You can select more than one filter at a time
- You can filter by author and narrator
- This announcement notification and panel
- A few new achievements and themes to go with them
- +1 / -1 for books
- A popular vs niche slider for discovering books
- The ability to "Mark Complete" books and a panel to show it
- Royal Road support, though I haven't added very much there yet (and you can filter them in or out)
- Many bug fixes

Thanks for using this silly little app. I hope it serves you well.
